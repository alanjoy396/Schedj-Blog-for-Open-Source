In the past week, I've worked on getting the data from SIS and putting it into data structures for the code to output. 
The part of that I've been working on is the backend part, where you get the data from SIS. I've also been helping with ideas. 
Chris, the project manager for this project, usually gives ideas for the app, and I give feedback on whether I think it's a good idea,
or I give ideas of my own.
