## Week 3

We came up with a proper plan of what to do for Open Source specifically; a version of the app that effectively only has the scheduling feature. This should help students who only need to schedule, and don't need to bulk of the entirety of SIS on their phone. 
We brought this up to Chris, the project manager at RCoS, and he was on board. But first, we need to work on the actual main app, so that it can properly schedule. 

Here is the status update for RCoS.
