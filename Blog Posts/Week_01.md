Overall, I think I'm focused on working on adding and dropping classes for now. I've been working on getting the API requests through Postman, and I want to transfer that to the JavaScript and Express code. Previously, I worked on logging in and accessing the student menu. I think I can get a lot of the API requests for the pages that are visible on SIS, so I think I'll focus on that for now. I also set up a shared Postman workspace so my other project members can work from it if necessary.
